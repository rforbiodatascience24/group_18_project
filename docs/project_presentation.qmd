## Introduction 1 {.smaller .hidden}
{output: false}
According to the instructions of leon, we need a 10 slide presentations so we could have the following structure:

1.  Introduction

-   Data and problem to analyze
-   visuzalization of data

2.  Materials and Methods

-   Libraries needed and why we are using them (recount and )
-   Which analsysis we did to the data

3.  Results

-   Graphs with most important results

4.  Disucssion

-   Biological insights of results
-   Conclusion based on insights

## Introduction:{.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=3}

![Most common cancer in women worldwide](image/cancer_ribbon.png){.fragment .fragment-1}


![1 in 8 diagnosed ](image/cancer_women.jpeg){.fragment .fragment-2}

![Many subtypes require a large collection of data](../results/TCIA_logo.png){.fragment .fragment-3}
:::

Question: Which genes are differentially expressed in different subtypes of cancer


## Materials and Methods 1

## Materials and Methods 2:{.smaller}

Considerations about the data:<br>
  - Excluded men as they represented a very small portion of the study<br>
  - We removed uninteresting genes (variance across samples of 0) <br>
  - Removed NAs and merged metadata with counts data

## DESEQ Analysis:


::: {.cell layout-align="center"}
![Male-female ratio](../results/04_volcano_plot.png){width="30%"}
:::
We can see that many of the differentially expressed genes are on the left side of the volcano plot.

## DESEQ Analysis: Top pathaways affected by DE genes



## PCA Analysis:{.smaller}
Here is an analysis of PCA plots showing the scree and cumulative variance explained.

<div class="fragment fragment-2">
  ![Cumulative](image/cummulative.png)
</div>
:::

The high dimentionality required to explain 85% of the variablity of the data shows that cancer is a difficult task

## PCA Analysis:{.smaller}


::: {.cell layout-align="center"}

![Overlapped clustering of patients](../results/scatter.png){width="30%"}
:::

The clusters from patients with and without tumor overlap, meaning the PCA is not separating clearly the clusters.



## Discussion: Biological insights

- We can see that the DE genes in the data affect most importantly X pathways
- THis makes/not makes sense with the literature as 1,2,3

## Conclusion:

## Next steps:
- Clustering of DE genes 
- Identification of more subtypes with clustering
-
