## Introduction:{.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=3}

![Most common cancer in women worldwide](image/cancer_ribbon.png){.fragment .fragment-1}


![1 in 8 diagnosed ](image/cancer_women.jpeg){.fragment .fragment-2}

![Many subtypes require a large collection of data](image/TCIA_logo.png){.fragment .fragment-3}
:::

Question: Which genes are differentially expressed in different subtypes of cancer


## General workflow

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND TIDY:{.smaller}
::: {layout-ncol=2 style="max-width: 80%;"}

![Ratio between male and female](../results/02_male_female_ratio.png)

![Age of femmale patients stratified by cancer status](../results/03_female_age_diagnosis_boxplot.png)


![Country of origin of female patients](../results/03_female_country_distribution.png)

## ANALYSIS:

![Male-female ratio](../results/04_volcano_plot.png){width="30%"}
:::
We can see that many of the differentially expressed genes are on the left side of the volcano plot.

## DESEQ Analysis: Top pathaways affected by DE genes



## PCA Analysis:{.smaller}
Here is an analysis of PCA plots showing the scree and cumulative variance explained.

</div>

<div class="fragment fragment-2">
  ![Cumulative](image/cummulative.png)
</div>
:::

The high dimentionality required to explain 85% of the variablity of the data shows that cancer is a difficult task

## PCA Analysis:{.smaller}


::: {.cell layout-align="center"}

![Overlapped clustering of patients](../results/scatter.png){width="30%"}
:::

The clusters from patients with and without tumor overlap, meaning the PCA is not separating clearly the clusters.



## Discussion: Biological insights

- We can see that the DE genes in the data affect most importantly X pathways
- THis makes/not makes sense with the literature as 1,2,3

## Conclusion:

## Next steps:
- Clustering of DE genes 
- Identification of more subtypes with clustering
-
